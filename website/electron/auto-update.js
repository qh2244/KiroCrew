/**
 * Desktop auto-update via electron-updater (macOS + Linux).
 *
 * WHY electron-updater instead of Electron's built-in autoUpdater: the built-in
 * updater covers only macOS (Squirrel.Mac) and Windows (Squirrel.Windows), and
 * requires us to hand-build the feed, the version compare and the publish
 * metadata. electron-updater generates that metadata at build time
 * (latest-mac.yml / latest-linux.yml), verifies sha512 fail-closed, adds Linux
 * support, and — on macOS — still drives Squirrel.Mac underneath, so the proven
 * atomic bundle swap is unchanged. See docs/guides/windows-install.md and issue #598.
 *
 * The ONE KiroCrew-specific concern vs. a plain Electron app is unchanged: the
 * bundled Python gateway is a long-running child process, so it MUST be stopped
 * gracefully BEFORE the app bundle is swapped — otherwise the swap races a live
 * child and can leave a half-replaced app. That is why autoInstallOnAppQuit is
 * forced OFF (see configureUpdater) and every install path goes through
 * stopGateway() first.
 *
 * Pure helpers (channelForFlavor, channelForVersion, resolveChannel,
 * buildFeedBase) are dependency-free and tested directly. initAutoUpdate takes
 * the electron + electron-updater surfaces injected so it stays testable
 * without an Electron runtime.
 *
 * The policy stays here: channels and their publish lanes, the feed and
 * download URLs, the update-policy flags, the externally-managed marker and the
 * install-shape probes. initAutoUpdate gates on them and then composes one of
 * two lanes from runtime/update/: the electron-updater feed lane, or the
 * marker-driven managed lane, both reporting through one state reporter.

// Default update feed host: updates.crew.kiro.dev, the pointer hostname of the
// public distribution CDN (CloudFront + OAC over the kirocrew-updates bucket).
//
// electron-updater's generic provider treats the configured URL as a DIRECTORY
// and resolves <base>/latest-mac.yml (macOS) or <base>/latest-linux.yml (Linux)
// from it. The artifact URLs inside those files are ABSOLUTE and point at the
// byte hostname (download.crew.kiro.dev), which is what preserves our
// pointer/bytes host split: `new URL(fileUrl, base)` ignores the base when
// fileUrl is absolute. That behaviour is structural but undocumented, so
// test/auto-update.test.js pins it against the real installed library — a
// version bump that changes it must fail CI, not strand installs in the field.

 * metadata — the test-harness seam, mirroring `KIROCREW_UPDATE_FEED`, and
 * honored ONLY on an unpackaged build: in a packaged app one env var in the
 * launch environment would otherwise name the file whose body we execute), then
 * the BAKED marker `<app code>/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` (inside app.asar, next to
 * this file — placed there at build time by `packaging/build-desktop.sh` when
 * `KIROCREW_MANAGED_INSTALL_MARKER` names one; read on a PACKAGED build only,
 * since in a dev checkout that directory is writable source), then the LOOSE marker
 * `<resourcesPath>/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` a repackager drops beside the app.
 * I/O-bearing and fully injectable, like resolveLinuxInstall above.
 *
 * The two on-disk shapes differ in WHO put the file there, which is what its
 * authority rests on. The loose marker is a post-build affordance for a distro
 * packager, so it is gated on provenance (below). The baked marker is part of
 * the application's own code: it ships in the same archive as main.js and this
 * module, so anyone positioned to rewrite it is already positioned to rewrite
 * the code that reads it, and no ownership probe can add anything to that. It
 * is therefore trusted as code is trusted — on every platform, Windows
 * included — and it outranks a loose marker when both exist, because a
 * build-time declaration by the edition that produced the binary is a stronger
 * statement than a file dropped next to it afterwards. On macOS the baked
 * marker is additionally sealed by codesign for free.
 *
 * The marker body is optional JSON `{managedBy, updateCommand, checkCommand}`:
 * `managedBy` names the owning system for the About panel, `updateCommand` is
 * the command the panel offers to copy AND (when the managed auto-update path
 * is active) the command run to apply an update, and `checkCommand` is the
 * optional command run to discover whether an update is available. Every
 * degenerate marker — empty, unparsable,
 * over-cap, a directory, a symlink, a dangling symlink — still means MANAGED:
 * an operator who dropped SOMETHING at that name gets the safe behavior
 * (updater off) even when the metadata is wrong, never a silent fallback to
 * self-updating. Entries are `lstat`ed and only regular files are read, so a
 * symlink can never route this startup-path read into a FIFO or device.
 *
 * INTEGRITY (loose marker only): the metadata is only parsed when neither the
 * marker nor its directory is OWNED by this euid or writable by group/other (see
 * canRewriteMarker) — `updateCommand`/`checkCommand` are SHELLED, so a marker
 * anything running as this user could rewrite is a marker that names arbitrary
 * code to run. A rewritable marker still means MANAGED, just with no metadata:
 * the same degenerate shape as an empty body, which leaves the updater off and
 * nothing to execute. Windows always takes that answer for a loose marker (no
 * POSIX owner to read); a baked marker is not probed on any platform.

// what to run". A marker we can rewrite is one a prompt-injected agent shell
// running as this user can rewrite, so its metadata is refused.
//
// The question is OWNERSHIP, not the current mode bits. `access(W_OK)` answers
// "can I write this right now", and a POSIX owner can always `chmod +w` back —
// so on exactly the user-owned installs this exists to defend (Homebrew,
// `pip --user`, ~/Applications) an attacker would plant the marker, `chmod 0400`
// it, and be handed the trusted verdict. Provenance is what the metadata's
// authority rests on, so provenance is what is probed:
//
//   - a file or directory OWNED by this euid is rewritable (chmod is ours),
//   - a group- or world-writable one is rewritable by whoever else holds it, and
//   - one the KERNEL says we can write is rewritable however that was granted.
//
// The third arm is not redundant with the second: POSIX mode bits do not model
// ACLs, so a root-owned 0755 directory carrying a macOS `chmod +a` (or Linux
// setfacl) entry for this user is writable while every mode bit reads safe.
// access(W_OK) is the only check that sees that grant.
//
// Both the marker and its directory are checked, because either one controls the
// content: a writable directory allows replacing the file outright, and a file
// we own is rewritable even inside a directory we do not.
//
// Fail-CLOSED — the OPPOSITE direction to isBundleContainerWritable below. There
// a probe that cannot run must not disable updates; here a marker whose
// provenance cannot be established must not be executed. The cost of the safe
// answer is only "no metadata", which is the historical bare-marker behavior.
// Windows takes that answer UNCONDITIONALLY and by declaration: it has no POSIX
// owner to read, and `access(W_OK)` there does not model ACLs, so there is no
// honest verdict to give. A Windows install therefore never honors a LOOSE
// marker's commands; a packager that needs them there bakes the marker into the

/**
 * Should a discovered version drive the AUTOMATIC update path — the background

 *
 * - YES for a genuine upgrade (candidate strictly newer than the running build).
 * - YES for ANY version when the FOLLOWED channel differs from the build's own
 *   DEFAULT (no-preference) channel: that is a deliberate channel switch — the
 *   user's stored preference has actively moved this install off the lane it
 *   would otherwise follow — where landing on an older build of the chosen
 *   channel is the intended, user-initiated outcome `allowDowngrade=true` exists
 *   for.
 * - NO for a same-channel version that is NOT newer than the running build.
 *   That is a build running AHEAD of what its own channel has published
 *   (locally-built or prerelease bytes ahead of the feed): from that channel's
 *   point of view there is nothing to install, so electron-updater's
 *   difference-based `update-available` (which fires for any version ≠ running,
 *   because allowDowngrade=true) would otherwise nag a DOWNGRADE. This is the
 *   bug this guard closes.
 *
 * **Why the switch signal is the DEFAULT lane, not the byte stamp.** A promoted
 * stable release ships the soaked insider candidate's exact bytes, so its
 * version keeps the insider stamp (`0.3.0-insider.13`) and `channelForVersion`
 * reports `insider` for a build that is, in fact, a stable install following the
 * stable feed with no deliberate switch. Keying the exemption on that raw stamp
 * (`followed=stable !== stamped=insider`) therefore fired for the ENTIRE
 * promoted-stable population — and for any prerelease-stamped build running ahead
 * of stable (`0.5.0-insider.20`) — re-opening the exact downgrade nag this guard
 * removes. So the comparison uses `defaultChannel = resolveChannel(stamped, "")`
 * (the lane with no preference, which folds promoted-insider bytes to stable),
 * and the exemption fires only when the FOLLOWED channel differs from THAT — i.e.
 * an explicit preference actually moved the install to a non-default lane.
 *
 * `allowDowngrade` stays true, so a real channel switch and any EXPLICIT user
 * download still roll the version; only the unsolicited auto-path is suppressed.
 *
 * Fail-open: an unrankable comparison (isNewerVersion → null) is treated as
 * offerable, so a version we cannot compare is never silently hidden.
 *
 * TRADE-OFF (deliberate, not accidental): a same-channel version RETRACTION —
 * the feed intentionally repointed to an older build — also reads as "not
 * newer, same channel" and is therefore no longer auto-applied. The client
 * cannot tell a retraction from an ahead-of-feed dev build by version alone, and
 * silently DOWNGRADING a user on the next restart is the more dangerous default,
 * so the safe direction is to not auto-act. A deliberate `retracted` feed flag
 * could re-enable that path explicitly in future.

/**

 * last path segment is replaced rather than appended (".../feed/nightly" would
 * resolve to ".../feed/latest-mac.yml" — the wrong channel, or a 404).
 * electron-updater's newBaseUrl() also normalises this, but emitting it here

/**
 * Apply the update-policy flags this app REQUIRES. Every one of these differs
 * from the electron-updater default, and each maps to a decision we already
 * made deliberately — so they are set in one audited place rather than
 * scattered:
 *
 * - autoDownload=false        electron-updater must never fetch from INSIDE
 *                             checkForUpdates. This is not the same question as
 *                             "may an update download without a click": that is
 *                             a policy read per discovery from
 *                             getAutoDownloadPreference(), and when it is on the
 *                             "update-available" handler calls startDownload()
 *                             itself. Keeping the library flag false is what
 *                             makes every download — automatic or consented —
 *                             pass through that one guarded function, so the
 *                             preference can actually turn it off and the
 *                             re-entrancy guards apply to both callers.
 *                             It also keeps discovery cheap on macOS: see the
 *                             autoInstallOnAppQuit note below for why staging,
 *                             not fetching, is the dangerous step there.
 * - autoInstallOnAppQuit=false FALSE ON EVERY PLATFORM, for two different
 *                             reasons -- electron-updater gives this one flag
 *                             two unrelated meanings:
 *
 *                             • Linux/Windows (AppImageUpdater/NsisUpdater
 *                               extend BaseUpdater): it means what the name
 *                               says. BaseUpdater.addQuitHandler() installs on
 *                               quit WITHOUT stopping the Python gateway.
 *                               deferredInstallOnQuit() does it in order.
 *
 *                             • macOS (MacUpdater extends AppUpdater, NOT
 *                               BaseUpdater, so electron-updater registers no
 *                               quit handler at all): it decides WHEN Squirrel
 *                               is handed the zip. That is NOT merely a latency
 *                               choice, because Squirrel.Mac arms the installer
 *                               at STAGE time, not at install time:
 *                               SQRLUpdater's prepareUpdateForInstallation
 *                               writes ShipItState.plist and LAUNCHES ShipIt,
 *                               a launchd job that waits on our pid and swaps
 *                               the bundle as soon as we die -- by any exit,
 *                               including a crash, Force Quit or logout.
 *                               Electron documents the consequence: "a
 *                               successfully downloaded update will always be
 *                               applied the next time the application starts."
 *                               quitAndInstall() only flips
 *                               launchAfterInstallation and terminates.
 *
 *                               Keeping this false is therefore what makes the
 *                               gateway-before-swap ordering SELF-ENFORCING:
 *                               Squirrel cannot swap because it does not have
 *                               the bytes until quitAndInstall(), which is only
 *                               reachable after an awaited stopGateway(). There
 *                               is no API to un-arm ShipIt once armed, so
 *                               eager staging would also defeat retraction --
 *                               a withdrawn build would still install on quit.
 *
 *                               Cost of this choice: the ~350MB loopback pull
 *                               happens inside quitAndInstall(), so the handoff
 *                               is slow. forceExitFailsafe() is gated on
 *                               before-quit-for-update precisely because of
 *                               that. Making staging eager safely needs an
 *                               "armed" flag that is never cleared plus an
 *                               awaited stopGateway() on EVERY quit path.
 *
 * - allowDowngrade=true       our update gate is DIFFERENCE-based, not
 *                             greater-than: a feed repointed to an older
 *                             version must be offered. This is what makes

  // or network share lives there too and is perfectly replaceable, so the
  // verdict rests on whether the bundle's containing directory is writable.

  // platforms agree on nothing but the question: an AppImage self-replaces via
  // `mv` into dirname($APPIMAGE) and so shares the writability requirement,
  // while a deb install is handed to dpkg behind an elevation prompt and needs
  // no writable directory at all.

  // so About shows "unavailable" instead of a live Check button that no-ops.
