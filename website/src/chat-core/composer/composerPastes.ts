/**
 * The Paste atom (chat-core RFC §3 layer 4, P3-c): the collapsed paste blocks
 * behind the composer text's `[ Paste #N · M lines ]` tokens.
 *
 * A large paste becomes a token in the text and a block here. The editor
 * (`ChatInput`) adds and removes blocks as the user pastes, deletes a chip or
 * expands one; it reaches them through the `Composer` root, which carries the
 * host's {@link ComposerPasteSlice} (`<Composer pastes>`), so a host mounting
 * the root threads no paste props. Around a submit three things happen to the
 * blocks, each owned here or by the turn rather than by the host:
 *
 * - expand-on-send: the submit hands `blocks` to `buildOutgoingTurn`, which
 *   expands the live ones on the wire and returns the ones it expanded;
 * - bubble store: {@link storeSentPastes} records a send's blocks so history
 *   load can re-collapse the server's expanded echo into the same chips;
 * - carry-back: a refused submit's blocks come back through `carry`,
 *   renumbered past the blocks the composer holds now, so no two tokens share
 *   a number (the panes; the main chat still carries its blocks in ChatPage).
 *
 * `read()` is the latest block list without waiting for a render: `install`
 * and `carry` advance it synchronously, so two carries landing in one React
 * batch compose (the second carries on top of the first instead of erasing
 * its blocks while both tokens reach the text). `set` is the plain state
 * setter the editor's own edits go through, and `read()` catches up with it
 * on the next render.
 *
 * State only, no effects: a host can call the hook wherever its state sat
 * without moving any effect in its order. Where blocks persist per slot stays
 * the host's (each keeps its drafts differently). No Redux.
