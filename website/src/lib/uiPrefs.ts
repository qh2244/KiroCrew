/**
 * Host-side backup for the dashboard settings that live in `localStorage`.
 *
 * The problem this solves: most settings the user sets in the UI are stored
 * only in the renderer's `localStorage`, and `localStorage` is keyed by ORIGIN
 * and (in the desktop app) kept inside Electron's `userData` directory. Both
 * can change without the user doing anything: the dashboard port moves, the
 * `userData` directory is relocated by a package rename, the user switches
 * between the stable and nightly builds, or the browser evicts the origin. Each
 * of those looks identical from the user's chair — "I upgraded and had to set
 * everything up again" — even though nothing on the host was lost, because
 * nothing on the host was ever written.
 *
 * So: mirror the durable subset to the gateway (`/api/ui-prefs`, stored in the
 * data home), and read it back when a profile shows up with none of those keys.
 *
 * Design decisions worth knowing before changing this file:
 *
 * 1. **Read on a COLD profile only.** The server copy is a backup, not a live
 *    cross-tab sync channel. If any durable key exists locally, that copy wins
 *    and the server is only written to. Reading on every boot would let a stale
 *    backup fight a tab the user just changed, and would make two browsers on
 *    one host tug settings back and forth.
 * 2. **Snapshot-diff, not write interception.** ~300 call sites write
 *    `localStorage` directly. Rather than route them all through one writer (a
 *    migration that would go stale the next time someone adds a raw call), this
 *    module periodically reads the allowlisted keys and PUTs what changed. Any
 *    writer, present or future, is covered.
 * 3. **Explicit allowlist, no prefix wildcards for session-scoped keys.**
 *    Ephemeral and per-session state (height caches, panel tabs, drafts,
 *    touched files, web-preview URLs) is deliberately excluded: it is worthless
 *    on another origin, it is what the quota reclaimer already evicts, and
 *    mirroring it would grow without bound.
 * 4. **Keys already mirrored server-side are excluded** — theme mode, theme
 *    colour, language and the onboarding flags reconcile through
 *    `/api/config/theme` and `dashboard.*` config. Backing them up here too
 *    would create a second source of truth for the same setting.

 * The one durable key whose VALUE is a JSON object of independent settings,

 *
 * `mc-chat-config` holds ~20 settings a user sets at different times across
 * different origins (the phone over the tunnel, the macOS app, a desktop
 * browser). Synced as one opaque string, a profile that changes any ONE of them
 * uploads the whole blob -- including its own, possibly stale, copy of every
 * other field -- and the host (which merges per localStorage KEY, not per field)
 * replaces the stored blob wholesale. So a second origin holding older Pin or
 * Compact values overwrites the host copy of settings it never touched, and the
 * phone's next cold restore brings those stale values back (issue #15236).
 *
 * Projecting each field onto its own wire key makes the host's existing per-key
 * merge a per-FIELD merge: a profile uploads only the fields it actually
 * changed, so it never writes a field it did not touch. The server stays opaque
 * -- it never parses the value, it just has more, smaller keys. The split lives
 * entirely in the projection helpers below; `buildPatch`, the per-key retry,
 * fingerprints, deletion and the growth-gap reconcile all operate on the child
 * keys as ordinary durable keys.
 *
 * One composite exists today. Sibling blobs (`mc-notification-sound`,
 * `kc:file-explorer:state:v2`) share the shape and could join, but this change
 * ships only the key the issue is about; the helpers take the single key
 * directly rather than iterating a registry built for members that do not exist.

 * Why this exists: a composite child is withheld from the flush while it is

 * never uploaded over another origin's host value. But that same withholding
 * also drops a value the user DELIBERATELY set to its default -- a brand-new
 * field another origin seeded, that the user then edits locally back to the
 * default -- because "equals the default" and "has no fingerprint" are
 * indistinguishable from the stored blob alone (`loadChatConfig` fills every
 * field with its default, so the blob never records which were chosen). The
 * reconcile then baselines it without uploading, and a later storage reset
 * restores the stale host value over the user's choice (GPT 5.6 F1, :697).
 *
 * The fix is a marker, not write interception: `saveChatConfig` is the single
 * seam every chat-config edit already passes through, and it alone knows which
 * fields changed. It records the changed field names here, and a dirty child is
 * forced into the upload even when it equals the known default and carries no
 * fingerprint. The marker is cleared per field the moment that field's value is
 * successfully flushed (`commitSent`), so it never forces a second upload.
