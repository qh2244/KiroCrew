/**
 * CrewmateMessage — one of the crewmate's messages in its chat: the bubble,
 * placed in the row its run position dictates. The chat is a 1:1 thread with
 * one speaker besides the user, and the DM header already names that speaker
 * (face + name chip), so the message carries NO author line — no avatar, no
 * name, no time row — and no avatar gutter; the bubble takes the full text
 * column. Consecutive messages still read as one speaker through the grouped
 * corners `crewmateBubbleClass` paints along a run.
 *
 * The bubble itself is the ordinary AssistantMessage (markdown, option chips,
 * hover actions all intact); this component only places it.
