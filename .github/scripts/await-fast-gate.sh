# The Fast Gate barrier's poll: read the Fast Gate run for THIS commit and fail
# closed until it concludes success, so ci.yml's heavy matrix never starts on a
# gate that was not confirmed. Invoked from the `await-fast-gate` job in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml with the identity of the commit under test in the
# environment:
#
#   GH_TOKEN REPO SHA EVENT BRANCH HEAD_REPO
#
# and nothing else. The job's step is one line -- `bash
# .github/scripts/await-fast-gate.sh` -- so this file IS the barrier's logic.
#
# ## Why a script and not an inline `run:` body
#
# The barrier is not enforced by GitHub: every property that makes its read
# trustworthy (identify the run by its full identity triple, fail closed in all
# three unreadable directions) is asserted by test_fast_gate_barrier.py. Keeping
# the body in a file lets that test run the WHOLE poll against a stubbed `gh` and
# a fake clock -- every classification case end to end, not just the jq selector
# and conclusion `case` as isolated fragments. The workflow gains nothing from
# carrying the shell inline, and the test gains coverage of the loop's control
# flow rather than its two islands alone.
#
# ## Why `.github/scripts/` and not the repo-root `scripts/`
#
# Root `scripts/` holds product and dev tooling a contributor runs by hand. This
# is workflow-only glue: it reads the commit identity ci.yml resolves from
# `github.event.*` and has exactly one caller. It lives next to the workflow that
# is its only caller, alongside the other extracted workflow scripts.
#
# ## Test seams (production defaults are exact)
#
# Four values are read through `${VAR:-default}` so the test can drive the loop
# without real waits, and every default reproduces the inline body byte for byte:
#
#   APPEAR_BUDGET   180   seconds a missing run is tolerated as the start-up race
#   TOTAL_BUDGET    720   seconds the whole poll may run before failing closed
#   AWAIT_FG_NOW    date +%s   the clock; overridden with a script that prints a
#                              fake, advancing epoch so the budgets are reached in
#                              zero wall-clock time
#   AWAIT_FG_SLEEP  sleep      the wait between polls; overridden with `:` (a
#                              no-op) so the test spins the loop instantly
#
# On the real runner none of the four is set, so the poll is identical to the
# body it replaced. `gh` and `jq` are found on PATH exactly as before, which is
# also how the test substitutes a stub `gh`.
