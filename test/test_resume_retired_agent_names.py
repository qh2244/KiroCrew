"""A resumed conversation resolves the agent its record names, even after a cleanup.

Two records outlive what they name. A crewmate row the startup prune removed is
covered for its basic shape in ``test_chat_agent_selection.py``; the cases here
pin the edges of that fallback. A ``kirocrew-skill-view-<digest>`` name recorded
while the native skill projection was on outlives its view file once a boot
drain or cleanup removes it; resolution maps it back to its source agent through
the projection's ownership sidecar before deciding the turn is unavailable.
