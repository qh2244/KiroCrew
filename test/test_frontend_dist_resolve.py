"""Tests for ``kiro_crew.frontend.ensure_dev_dist_symlink``.

Covers the runtime dist-resolution contract described:

* pre-bundled real directory is left alone (packaged install / prior build)
* valid symlink is kept
* a dangling / index-less symlink is replaced, unless it points at this
  checkout's ``website/dist`` outside an edition (kept until the build lands)
* sibling ``KiroCrewWebsite/dist`` is resolved and symlinked
* nothing-found returns ``None`` (caller logs warning and serves legacy UI); a
  stock checkout still links its unbuilt ``website/dist``
