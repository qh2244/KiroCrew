"""A turn that ends without EVENT_COMPLETE still records its usage row.

The dashboard's only ``persist_token_record_async`` call lives in the
``EVENT_COMPLETE`` branch, so a turn torn down through ``_persist_partial_reply``
-- the 6-hour turn ceiling, the Stop button, a signed-out CLI mid-turn, and the
other recovery paths that share that seam -- wrote no usage row and no
``meta.turn_stats``, leaving its credits unrecorded however much it billed (the
ceiling path recorded zero credits for a six-hour, 91-tool-call turn).

These drive the extracted ``_persist_abnormal_turn_usage`` seam helper over the
REAL row store, asserting the row lands with the turn's recovered credits and a
terminal stop reason, that a turn which billed nothing writes none, that a
cost-only claude-seam turn records too, and that a turn dying before it installs
fresh billing stats does NOT re-bill the previous turn (the ``since=`` guard).

The riskiest invariant is the claim/seam guard itself: ``EVENT_COMPLETE`` claims
the turn's single row BEFORE its awaited (thread-offloaded) persist, so a
cancellation landing on that await unwinds into the abnormal-end seam, which must
see the row already claimed and write nothing. ``TestCancelDuringCompletePersist``
drives the real ``_run_chat`` to ``EVENT_COMPLETE``, cancels inside the persist
after one row is written, and asserts exactly one row -- with the REAL
``provider_last_turn_usage`` live and billing available, so a regression that
lets the seam re-read and re-bill produces a second row and reddens the test.
