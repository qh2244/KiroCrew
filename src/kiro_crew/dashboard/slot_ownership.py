"""The app-ownership decision every per-slot route goes through.

``/api/chat/slots/{slot}/...`` is one URL family, and an app's ``permissions.api``
grant is a PREFIX match (``token_auth._api_pattern_matches``): an app granted
``/api/chat`` reaches every path under it. Whether an app may act on a slot is
therefore decided once for the whole family rather than by each handler.

:func:`slot_ownership_middleware` decides it once, at the route, for every handler
registered under the family, whatever the slot segment is called:

* A caller with no app claim (the dashboard user, an internal-secret call with no
  derived app) is untouched here. Handlers keep their own owner and identity
  checks for those callers.
* An app caller passes only when it is the slot's OWNER app,
  ``slot._app == request["app"]``, AND the slot still runs on its own session and
  writes its own transcript (:func:`app_owns_slot_session`). Identity is positive:
  a slot with no app scope is refused, never read as "nobody's, so anyone's".
* Every refusal is the same 404 ``slot_not_found`` body, a missing slot included,
  so no response on these routes tells "not yours" from "does not exist". A
  refusal for a slot that exists is recorded in the security-event log; a name
  that matches no slot is not, so an app polling a closed tab cannot flood it.

The decision is keyed by the PATH segment. A handler that reads another slot key
from the body, query or a header decides that key itself.

A route takes a different decision only through :data:`SLOT_ROUTE_POLICIES`, with
a written reason. ``test/test_slot_ownership_checkpoint.py`` enumerates every
route under ``/api/chat/slots/{...}`` straight from the router and pins that the
checkpoint decides each one, so a new per-slot route is owner-gated by
construction and an exception is a reviewed edit.

The middleware publishes the slot object it judged as ``request[CHECKPOINT_SLOT_KEY]``.
A handler that awaits before it looks the slot up compares against it
(:func:`checkpoint_slot_replaced`), so a same-name replacement inside that await
is refused rather than acted on unjudged.

Handler-level calls to :func:`deny_app_slot_access` stay at the routes that carry
them. Behind the checkpoint they never refuse; they catch a handler mounted
outside the chain (a test app, a future router).
