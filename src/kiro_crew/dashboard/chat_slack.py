    Body: ``{"paused": bool}``, defaulting to ``true``. This is the whole of the
    dashboard's Slack connect/disconnect control for a session that already has a
    thread, in BOTH directions — which is why it SETS a state rather than only
    muting. Reconnecting by re-issuing ``slack-link`` cannot serve a session that
    was BORN in its thread: there is no binding to re-establish, so the row would
    render with no way back. One endpoint that sets either way keeps every row
    behaving identically regardless of how its conversation started.

    Disconnecting is not unlinking. The thread binding, both coordinate fields and
    the reverse index all survive, so a reply in the thread still resolves to THIS
    session and resumes it rather than forking a new one; only outbound turn
    mirroring stops (see ``chat_utils.slack_mirror_is_paused`` for the exact
    scope).

    The write stays ON the event loop, matching ``slack-unlink``: the session map
    has no cross-thread lock, so the loop is the only thing serialising its
    writers, and a flag write moved into a worker could interleave with a
    loop-side relink.

    Idempotent, reporting the prior state as ``was_paused``. Auth posture is
    identical to slack-link and slack-unlink — mixed-internal via the
    ``/api/chat`` prefix, needing no new entry in either path set.
