    Without an indexer the index never gets built and search silently stays on
    the scan path — correct, and as slow as it was (measured 6.7 s per keystroke
    on a 2.96 GB corpus, against ~0.3 s indexed).

    The indexing itself runs in a spawned child process, not here. It is
    pure-Python CPU (read, ``casefold``, project, insert), so as an
    ``asyncio.to_thread`` call it held the GIL that this gateway's event loop
    needs: ``py-spy top --gil`` attributed 28% of all GIL-holding samples to it,
    and the loop showed ``event-loop heartbeat: lag 1.0-6.6s`` on an 84%-idle
    machine. See ``kiro_crew.history_index_worker`` for why a process rather than
    a thread, why spawn rather than fork, and why deletion stays here.

    This gateway keeps only the read-only query path, plus the one index write
    that belongs to deletion (``delete_session`` removes a session's indexed text
    before unlinking the transcript and aborts if it cannot).

    What is left here is supervision: start the child, restart it if it dies,
    stop it when this gateway stops. Three things retire the child, and the
    order matters because the first two can be skipped: this task's ``finally``
    asks it to stop, ``daemon=True`` has ``multiprocessing`` reap it at
    interpreter exit, and failing both the child retires ITSELF once it sees this
    process is gone. Only the third survives a hard exit — the shutdown and
    restart paths can end this process with ``os._exit``, which runs no
    ``atexit`` handler, so neither parent-side path is guaranteed to run. That is
    why the child re-checks its parent on a short slice rather than once per pass:
    it bounds how long an orphan can keep indexing beside its replacement.

    A failure to keep a child running is logged once and then left alone: a
    missing row costs one scanned file, so the honest response to an indexer that
    will not stay up is to keep serving searches from the transcripts.
    """

    # The child's own pass cadence lives with the loop that honours it, in

        version bump the gateway and the child can both read the stale version
        and both run the DROP — the later one discarding the tables the earlier
        one just built, along with anything indexed in between. Nothing
        authoritative is lost (the rows derive from transcripts) but search falls
        back to scanning until a later pass repopulates it.

        Opening it here, before the child is started, means the on-disk version is
        already current when the child first opens and the gate cannot fire in two
        processes at once. Blocking, so the caller hands it to a thread.
