    The startup prune (``crewmate_prune_migration``) decides from each
    candidate's Crewmates-page DM thread which sync-generated crewmates were
    never chatted with, then
    deletes their rows. Every writer that can bind an agent to a session while
    the gateway is up reaches it through a mutating request -- the chat send,
    slot create, slot agent switch, member thread, channel and import routes
    under ``/api/``, and the OpenAI-compatible ``POST /v1/chat/completions`` --
    so ONE middleware holds every non-safe-method request until the pass

    pass has settled and never lists a row the pass is removing
    (``_CREWMATE_PRUNE_GATE_HELD_PREFIXES``). The writers that do not come
    through HTTP wait in ``await_crewmate_prune_settled`` instead.

    Armed HERE, before ``_start_site`` binds the listener, so no request can
    pass between the bind and the pass. The pass itself is kicked as a tracked
    background task right after the bind (``_kick_crewmate_prune``) and sets
    ``crewmate_prune_settled`` in its ``finally``, so the hold is the pass
    alone and readiness is not gated by it. Other reads are never held, and
    the fast path is one ``is_set()`` read, which is what every request pays
    once the pass has settled. A held request that outlives the budget is
    answered 503 and writes nothing; it does not abandon the pass.

    bind and ``KIROCREW_READY`` (``no-new-work-on-gateway-boot-path``, item 3).
    Same shape as ``_kick_knowledge_orphan_reclaim``: kicked after ``_start_site``
    returns, run on a worker thread (config lock and file reads are IO). The
    gate armed before the bind holds every mutating request until the event is
    set, which happens in ``finally`` whatever the pass does. Nothing on the
    readiness path waits for it -- not even the slot restores: a row the pass
    removes has, by its own evidence rule, no DM binding and no session whose
    metadata names it, so no restore can rebuild a slot for it. The writers
    that do NOT come through HTTP -- channel agent resume, cron dispatch, the
    subagent pump -- start only after ``await_crewmate_prune_settled`` returns
    (``GatewayOrchestrator.run`` after the memory barrier, past
    ``KIROCREW_READY``; the standalone dashboard before its inline channel
    resume), so none of them can bind a crewmate while the pass is judging it.
    The one startup step that DELETES a transcript, the channel transcript
    migration, merges but keeps its copies while the event is clear and
    removes them from ``_kick_deferred_transcript_removal`` once it is set, so
    the pass reads every first line the boot started with; a transcript that
    still vanishes under the pass voids it (nothing removed).
    The pass reads ``crewmate_prune_abandon`` before each candidate and again
    inside the config lock before each delete; that helper sets it when the
    pass outlives its budget, and the pass then finishes without deleting.
    The pass itself takes a cross-process lock beside its marker for its whole
    length, so a second gateway on the same data home cannot run its own pass
    beside this one -- its pass waits on that lock (its writers held by its
    own barrier meanwhile) and then finds the marker. On every boot but the
