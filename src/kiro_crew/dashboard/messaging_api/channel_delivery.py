    ``configured_targets()`` is the channel-neutral allowlist the dashboard's own

    transport marks unavailable (WeCom may only reply to an inbound message), and
    a thread or room target, which is a wider audience than a DM.

    No channel carries a separate "owner" field the way Slack's ``owner_id`` does,
    so an owner can only be inferred, and this REFUSES to infer one from an
    ambiguous list: a target is returned only when the channel advertises exactly
    ONE available direct target. Picking the first of several would send private
    agent output to whichever allow-listed person happened to sort first, which is
    the wrong human rather than a smaller audience, and fanning out to all of them
    would deliver a message the agent decided to send once N times. With no single
    answer the caller degrades to the dashboard notification, which reaches the
    operator without guessing who they are.

    The inference itself is :func:`~kiro_crew.messaging.transport.sole_direct_target`,
    shared with session control's owner-DM audience predicate so the two surfaces
    name the same human as the owner; this wrapper adds only the enumeration guard
