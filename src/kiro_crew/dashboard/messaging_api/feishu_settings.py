"""The Feishu settings API: ``GET``/``PUT /api/feishu/config``.

Feishu (飞书/Lark) has the same two-credential shape as WeCom: FEISHU_APP_ID +
FEISHU_APP_SECRET live in config_dir/.env (0600), non-secret config (enabled,
allowed_open_ids, allow_group, allowed_group_ids, soft_threshold_pct,
session_folder) lives in config.json under the "feishu" key. GET returns masked
previews + presence booleans; raw values are write-only. The UI maps
FEISHU_APP_SECRET onto the shared panel's primary secret ("bot_token") and
FEISHU_APP_ID onto its second credential field ("bot_id").

Group access is a SEPARATE axis from the DM allow-list here (unlike WeCom's
allow-all switch): allow_group gates group chats at all, and allowed_group_ids
names which ones. Both fail closed — allow_group with an empty list serves no
group, which is why the panel shows a hint rather than silently doing nothing.
