"""Dashboard file HTTP handlers: the facade over :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.file_api`.

Routes, the handlers package and tests import and patch every file handler through
this module. The handler families live in the ``file_api`` owners -- ``uploads``,
``workspaces``, ``pinned_io``, ``transfer``, ``office_preview``, ``sheet``,
``search``, ``path_complete``, ``grep``, ``browse``, ``project_dirs``,
``git_panel``, ``project_tree`` and ``dashboard_config`` -- and ``file_api.compose``
runs them on this module's globals, so a patch of ``files.<name>`` reaches them.

This module keeps the imports, constants and seams the owners read, the
``_run_path_probe`` chokepoint, file delivery (the outbox routes and the Slack and
channel uploads with their shared admission gate), and the handlers repository
guards read here by path: ``api_reveal_path``, ``api_upload``, ``api_screenshot``,
``api_file_read`` with ``_owner_view_bypasses_credential_pass``, ``api_file_diff``,
``api_file_raw``, ``api_file_write`` and ``api_file_grep``. The directory-picker
routes ``api_browse_dirs`` and ``api_browse_files`` stay here too, over the
``browse`` listings. New work goes to the owner of its family; ``docs/system-specs/modules/learn-cron-dashboard.md`` records
the map.

        download would otherwise leave no trace.

        *granted* arrives already resolved because reading it ends in a

        authenticated caller -- widening the audience as a side effect of a control
        meant to narrow it, and contradicting the "owner's own authenticated
        browser" audience this class is scoped to.

        One function for both content kinds on purpose: a text file and a media
        file carrying the same credential reach the same audience through this
        route, so a second copy of the test is a second thing to forget.

    ``isfile`` / ``isdir`` probe. One helper means one pool hop per request, and
    it means these cannot be reintroduced on the event loop a call at a time.

    Blocking by design, and unboundedly so: a path whose mount is unresponsive
    (a disconnected network share, a wedged FUSE filesystem) makes ``realpath``
    and ``stat`` block for however long the kernel takes, and those syscalls are
    uninterruptible. Run on the event loop, ONE such request stalls every

    stall outlasting ``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs`` makes the loop
    watchdog kill the gateway. Which mount the path lands on is the caller's
    choice, not this process's.

    A ``ValueError`` from a malformed path (an embedded NUL makes ``realpath``
    raise) is deliberately NOT caught: it propagates exactly as it did when this
    ran inline, so no caller's answer for that input changes here.

    This probe is a verdict, not a handle. A caller that goes on to OPEN the path
    must not re-derive the descriptor from this answer in a second hop -- see
    :func:`_read_request_path` for why.

    Always reached through :func:`_run_path_probe`, never ``asyncio.to_thread``:
    a thread wedged in an uninterruptible ``stat`` never returns, so a caller
    repeatedly naming one dead mount would otherwise retire a default-executor
    worker per request until the rest of the gateway starves behind them. The
    dedicated pool caps the wedged threads and then refuses with 503, and no other

# ── Path completion (/api/path-complete; file_api/path_complete.py) ──────────
#
# The chat composer's shell-style `./` / `../` completion. A sibling of
# ``api_file_search`` rather than a mode of it, for two reasons that are
# not cosmetic:
#
# * ``/api/file-search`` answers "which files ANYWHERE under this root fuzzily
#   match these characters"; completion answers "what is IN this one directory".
#   A recursive fuzzy hit cannot be turned back into the path the user is typing
#   -- the entry name alone is not the path -- so the row set has to come from a
#   single directory level.
# * ``?project=`` on the search endpoint is any path on the host, by design.
#   Completion must be the opposite: the caller names a KNOWN project directory
#   (the same allow-list ``api_project_git`` / ``api_project_tree`` use) and the
#   ``../`` segments are resolved and then re-checked for containment, so no
#   token typed in the composer can enumerate a directory outside the project.

#: Rows returned by one completion request. The composer popup shows a handful;
#: this bounds the response for a directory with thousands of entries, which is
#: also where a shell's own completion stops being useful.
_PATH_COMPLETE_MAX_ENTRIES = 50

#: Either separator ends a segment of a typed path token. Both, on every platform:
#: a backslash IS a separator on Windows, so a token carrying one must be SPLIT
#: rather than appended as a single literal name that the OS then re-interprets at
#: the open -- which is how `..\..\etc` escaped a root that had already been
#: checked. The composer's own grammar is POSIX-style, so on POSIX this only
#: refuses to treat a backslash as part of a filename, which no completion token
#: means it to be.
_PATH_TOKEN_SEPARATORS = re.compile(r"[/\\]+")

#: Directory entries EXAMINED per request, independent of how many survive the
#: prefix filter. The listing is one level deep, so this is the only ceiling
#: needed -- it bounds ``node_modules``-sized directories, where the scan (not
#: the response) is the cost.
_PATH_COMPLETE_MAX_SCAN = 5000


# ── Content search (/api/file-grep; engines in file_api/grep.py) ──────────────
#
# The side-panel Files rail's Content mode: "which files CONTAIN this text".
# ``POST``, because the query travels in the body -- see ``api_file_grep``.
# Filename search is ``api_file_search``. The Files app's own search
# (``apps/builtins/file_explorer/server.py``) answers the same question in a
# separate process with its own allow-root model; the row shape is shared with
# it (``file``/``line``/``preview``; see `_grep_hit` for why there is no column)
# but nothing is shared at runtime -- gating here goes through this module's
# ``_validate_dashboard_path`` / ``is_sensitive_path`` chokepoint.

#: Wall-clock budget for ONE request, shared by the text and document passes.
#: The rail queries on a keystroke debounce, so a partial answer that SAYS it is
#: partial (``truncated``) beats a complete one that arrives after the user
#: stopped waiting.
_GREP_TIME_BUDGET_SECS = 2.0

_GREP_MAX_DIRS_VISITED = 20_000

#: Containers the document pass extracts. Their bytes hold no searchable plain
#: text, so the text pass skips them and this pass owns them -- no file is
#: reported twice. ``.pdf`` is extracted in a memory-bounded child
#: (``kiro_crew.pdf_extract``), never in this process: ``pdfplumber`` exposes no
#: length limit, so the only ceiling that can precede its allocation is a kernel
#: one on a process the gateway can afford to lose.
_GREP_DOC_EXTS = frozenset({".docx", ".pdf", ".pptx", ".xlsx"})
#: Largest document the pass will open. Extraction is CPU-bound parsing, so
#: this is about parse cost, not read cost.
_GREP_DOC_MAX_BYTES = 25 * 1024 * 1024

_GREP_DOC_MAX_CHARS = 400_000
#: How often the worksheet row loop reads the clock. An empty row yields no text,
#: so the character cap cannot see it and only the deadline can; a stride bounds
#: the overshoot to a fixed row count without paying ``monotonic()`` per row.

#: How long teardown waits for the reader thread and the killed child. Short:
#: a search must not hold a transfer-pool worker on something being torn down.
_GREP_RG_TEARDOWN_SECS = 2.0
#: How long the record loop blocks on one ``get`` before re-checking the deadline
#: and whether the reader died. Bounds only how long a FINISHED search whose
#: sentinel was dropped goes unnoticed; the search's budget is the deadline.
_GREP_RG_POLL_SECS = 0.05
#: Stands in for a record too large to queue. A real ``rg --json`` record starts
#: with ``{``, so a NUL-led string cannot be one.
_GREP_RG_OVERSIZE = "\0oversize"
#: Lines held between the rg reader thread and the parse loop. Small on purpose:
#: the reader blocks on a full queue, so a fast rg cannot buffer ahead of the
#: deadline check.
_GREP_RG_QUEUE_LINES = 64
#: Largest ``rg --json`` record the reader queues. ``--max-count 1`` bounds
#: records per FILE and ``--max-filesize`` bounds the file, but a matching line
#: in a minified blob is one multi-megabyte record, and a queue of those is
#: hundreds of MB. A record past this is skipped and marks the answer short.
_GREP_RG_MAX_RECORD_BYTES = 64 * 1024

#: Header ``doc_parser._extract_pptx`` writes before each slide's text.
_GREP_PPTX_SLIDE_RE = re.compile(r"^-{3}\s*Slide\s+(\d+)\s*-{3}$")

#: One document's extracted ``((label, text), ...)`` plus ``whole``: did the
