    named an agent would be refused on every fire until it auto-paused; a record

    identity-less instead. Either way the record is the schedule's own: the key

    attributed through. So the capture is written into it here, once.

    Two shapes, one identity. A record still in the legacy shape is rewritten

    ``replace_existing`` and the decoded value as ``expected``, and only when it
    differs from the capture in its template alone -- same member, store, mode

    member: the identity written is the one
    :func:`legacy_member_cron_execution` attributed, and a record that names
    anyone else, a restricted mode or an app is left as it is and logged, since
    dispatch will refuse it with its own reason. Not vouched: a cron key is never
    the caller slot of an own-store admission.
