"""Settle one ACP tool-permission request: decide it, audit it, answer it once.

A tool call reaches a surface as ``session/request_permission`` and is answered
on the wire at most once, whatever happens on the way. Deciding it is a
ladder -- floors, the hook gate, grants, an interject, a person, and the
surface's unattended refusal -- and answering it is a fixed sequence: write the
audit row, tell the model when the HOST refused (the in-band deny notice), then
approve or reject on the wire. :func:`settle` owns that whole sequence for a
surface described by a :class:`Policy`, and :func:`bail` answers a request a run
is abandoning. A caller owns none of the ordering.

The ladder, in order:

1. each floor may refuse;
2. the gate may refuse; otherwise its auto-approve becomes a :class:`Hit`;
3. the grants are walked in order, the gate's hit standing at
   :data:`GATE_GRANT`'s position. A low-fidelity child request under an enforced
   :class:`ChildRule` walks the rule's own grants instead and admits a hit only on
   evidence that reads no agent-authored event data. Otherwise the gate's
   auto-approve must still pass :func:`name_grant.refusal_for_event`; a refused
   name is narrated and audited and DOWNGRADES to the next stage, it never
   blocks. The first admitted hit is held;
4. the interject may tear the request down;
5. a held hit is approved; otherwise the first attended responder asks the
   person; otherwise the unattended refusal answers.

Invariants (``test/test_tool_permission.py`` pins each through this interface):

* every :func:`settle` / :func:`bail` that returns has answered the wire exactly
  once. The exceptions are deliberate: a refusal row that cannot be written under
  ``on_refusal_failure="withhold"`` raises before the wire, and a cancellation
  (or an approver error the policy lets propagate) while a person is asked
  leaves the request to the caller's teardown;
* a refusal is audited before any wire I/O: the steer is one more bounded await
  on the ACP pipe, and a backend that stops reading stdin cancels the caller at
  its turn deadline, which would leave the decision acted on and never audited
  if the row came last. An approval is audited after the wire answered, because
  its row records whether the transport floor turned it into a rejection;
* the deny notice is steered exactly when the host refused (a refusal with a
  cause), and always before the reject: while the request is unanswered the turn
  is provably in flight, which is what gets the notice queued rather than
  dropped (see ``kiro_crew.deny_notice``). A person's no and a teardown stay
  bare, because kiro-cli's "User denied tool execution" is then the truth, or
  there is no continuing turn for a notice to correct.

Each surface's SEL vocabulary is a row codec here (:class:`SubagentRows`,
:class:`TaskrunnerRows`), so a surface's rows are kept byte for byte while the
sequencing is shared. The module adds no output path of its own: row fields come
from the event and the codecs, SEL scrubs its text fields at write, and the
notice is built and scrubbed by ``llm_helpers._steer_host_deny``.
