"""The macOS Seatbelt profile a sandboxed agent spawn runs under.

:func:`render_seatbelt_profile` renders a :class:`~kiro_crew.sandbox_plan.ConfinementPlan`
as ``sandbox-exec`` profile text: a read deny over each masked tree (with the private
windows and the exposed files carved back out), write and hardlink denies over the trees
whose writes matter, and the approved write carve-outs last, because Seatbelt is
last-match-wins between an allow and a deny. What is masked, sealed or re-opened is the
plan's decision; this module only spells it as rules. ``kiro_crew.sandbox`` plans the
spawn, writes the text to ``<config_dir>/run`` and wraps the command in
``sandbox-exec -f <profile>`` (``sandbox_exec_argv``).
