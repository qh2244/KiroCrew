"""Build ACP ``session/prompt`` content blocks from a plain message string.

Channels hand the provider ONE string. When that string contains an absolute
path to a readable image, the image must travel as a real ACP image block --
a bare path is just text, and the model cannot see it. This module owns that
conversion so both prompt paths share one implementation:

* :meth:`kiro_crew.acp.session_handle.AcpSessionHandle.prompt` -- the live path
  for the public Kiro backend (``AcpProvider.start`` swaps ``AcpClient`` out for
  ``AcpSessionProvider``, so this is what actually reaches kiro-cli).
* :meth:`kiro_crew.acp.client.AcpClient._send_prompt` -- the direct-client path.

Keeping one builder matters: both paths need the same path-to-image
conversion, so a single implementation stops any channel from shipping a
filesystem path to the model as text.

    matched -- never inside a URL's own path or a longer local path that merely
    contains the same characters; a local path quoted as a URL query value
    (``?src=/tmp/a.png``) is a path to the grammar and is rewritten like any
    other. A second DISTINCT file with the same basename gets
    ``[image: <name> (2)]``, and so on; the same bytes under two names are one
    block, marked both places with the first name. Past ``max_prompt_image_blocks``
    blocks or ``max_prompt_image_b64_bytes`` of base64 in one prompt, a further

    ``allow_image=False`` (the agent did not advertise
    ``promptCapabilities.image``) leaves the path in the text untouched: the file
    is still on disk, so a tool-capable agent can open it, which is a strictly
    better fallback than dropping the reference. The result is always at least
    one text block, so a caller can pass it straight to ``session/prompt``.

    Inlined images are downscaled so their longest edge is at most
    ``max_image_edge`` px -- the server-side backstop for Anthropic's many-image
    dimension limit, applied for EVERY channel here regardless of any

      ``tool_use`` / ``tool_result`` / ``other`` for any unrecognised or
      typeless shape).
    * ``empty_text_blocks`` -- text blocks whose ``text`` is missing, blank, or
      whitespace-only (a structurally suspicious payload). A text block with no
      ``text`` key at all is as suspect as one whose ``text`` is a blank
      string, so both fold into this count.
    * ``tool_use`` / ``tool_result`` -- the two tool-block counts surfaced at
      the top level so a pairing imbalance (a ``tool_result`` with no matching
      ``tool_use``, or vice versa) is visible at a glance.
    * ``total_bytes`` -- length of ``json.dumps`` of the NORMALISED block list
      (``[]`` when the argument is not a list or tuple), the approximate
      serialized wire size of the outbound request. Measuring the normalised
      list keeps the size coherent with the counts: a non-list argument reports
      ``block_count: 0`` alongside ``total_bytes: 2`` (an empty ``[]``) rather
      than a size describing a payload the counts claim is empty.

    This summary is deliberately safe to log: it carries no content and
    therefore cannot leak credentials or user data. That is a hard
    requirement -- the kiro-cli data dir is fenced precisely because it holds
    SSO tokens, so the outbound-request diagnostics must expose counts, types,
    and sizes ONLY, never the bytes themselves.

    Defensive by contract: this is a diagnostics helper on the live prompt
    path, so it never raises. A malformed ``blocks`` argument (not a list,
    ``None`` entries, non-dict entries, unserialisable content) yields a
    partial/minimal summary instead of propagating an exception into the turn.
