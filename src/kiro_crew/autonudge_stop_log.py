"""Say why an auto-nudge loop stopped, in the gateway log.

A loop can stop on many paths: its cycle cap, its wall-clock budget, an
unanswered tool approval, a restart mid-cycle, an agent calling
``autonudge_stop``, a user delete, a closed session. Before this module several
of those were logged at INFO (hidden at the gateway's default level) and a
removed legacy loop left no row behind, so "the loop just stopped" could not be
explained after the fact.

The service calls :func:`stop_records` at its ONE store commit point, with the
set of loops that were active in the previous committed store and the rows of
the new one. Every loop that was active and now is not -- inactive or gone --
yields one record, whichever path stopped it, and each record is logged as one
WARNING line; grep ``gateway.log`` for ``AutoNudge:``.

Each boot moves ``gateway.log`` aside, so that line alone does not outlive a few
restarts. :func:`append_record` therefore also appends the same record, as one
JSON line, to ``<data home>/logs/autonudge_stops.jsonl`` (:data:`STOPS_FILE`).
That file is the record that survives restarts, bounded by
:func:`kiro_crew.jsonl_util.rotate_jsonl_at` to one ``.1`` generation.

Pure helpers only; the service owns locking and when to call them.
