"""The Slack thread context a native turn's prompt carries.

The thread's first message when a new Slack-born session opens in a thread it did not
start (``slack/thread_parent.py``, which also records it as the transcript's first row),
the replies posted since this conversation's last turn in the thread
(``slack/thread_replies.py``), and the ``conversations.replies`` fallback line that
stands in for the parent when its fetch found nothing. ``handle_message`` passes each
result to ``ContextBuilder.build_message``.

Composed onto :mod:`kiro_crew.slack.handler`; see
