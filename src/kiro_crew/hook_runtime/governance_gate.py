    *spawn_target* is the agent a backend-stated sub-agent spawn will start (set
    only from KAS's own ``_meta.kiro.consent``; see ``AcpEvent.spawn_target``).
    When set, ``capabilities.spawn`` is judged too -- the gate on, and the target
    in its ``agents`` scope -- on the SAME ceiling and profile this call resolved,
    so a spawn costs no second profile resolution and cannot be judged against a
    different profile snapshot. A spawn policy is not a ``tools`` rule, so the
    title question alone cannot answer it.

    *mcp_ref* is an already-canonical ``@server`` / ``@server/tool`` reference
    for the trusted MCP identity, evaluated in addition to (or instead of) the
    display title. It is passed as a reference rather than folded into
    *tool_name* because the title grammar cannot encode every identity; both are
    empty for a non-MCP call with no title, which governs nothing.

    *diff_path* is the diff content block's path for an edit-kind call; it joins
    the ``filesystem.write`` target set the gate classifies
    (``classify_tool_args``), so a diff-only edit is judged against an
    ALLOW-mode write confinement rather than reaching it pathless.

    Resolves the active profile (Level 2) for the calling surface and intersects
    it with the boot-frozen ceiling (Level 1).  Fast no-op when the host has
    neither a policy ceiling nor any profiles, so an ungoverned standalone host
    pays only an attribute read.  Emits a governance audit record on a deny.

    Fail-closed discipline mirrors the CPP shims: a ``PlatformCompositionError``
    (a non-standalone host that could not compose) is re-raised, never swallowed;
    any other unexpected error degrades to "no governance opinion" (None) so a
    transient profile-load glitch cannot wedge every tool call — the always-on
    deny floor in ``HookManager.on_tool_call`` already ran.
