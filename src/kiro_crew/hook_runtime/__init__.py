"""Private owners composed by :mod:`kiro_crew.hooks`.

The hook subsystem's rules are split by responsibility across the modules of this
package, and ``kiro_crew.hooks`` stays their only import path and their only patch
surface: nothing but the facade imports an owner.

Each owner holds functions moved verbatim from the one-module file. :func:`compose`
makes every function an owner defines run on the facade module's globals rather than
its own. 127 production modules import ``kiro_crew.hooks``, and the tests patch its
names -- ``hooks.MAX_FILE_BYTES``, ``.validate_file_path``, ``._fd_real_path``,
``.is_sensitive_path``, ``.os``, ``.run_script_hook``, ``.load_denied_commands_state``,
``.persisted_hook_store`` and dozens more. A function that read its owner's globals
would keep calling the unpatched object and the test would pass while exercising
nothing, so the hooks surface stays ONE namespace, as the one-module file was. Four
consequences follow:

* An owner's imports are inert for its functions. An owner imports the facade only
  under ``TYPE_CHECKING``, and stdlib names plainly; both serve the type checker and
  the linter. Every name a function reads must exist in ``kiro_crew.hooks``, and
  ``test/test_hooks_composition_contract.py`` sweeps each function's bytecode to
  prove it does.
* A function's ``__module__`` reads ``kiro_crew.hooks`` as it did before the split,
  so reprs and pickling by reference are unchanged and it logs through that module's
  ``logger``. Its source file differs, so a log record's ``module``, ``filename`` and
  ``lineno`` name the owner file.
* State stays on the facade. Every module-level value -- the constants and event
  vocabularies, the deny-target grammar tables, the internal-read allowlists, the
  app and builtin-agent registries, the two UNC root memos, the global script-hook
  store, the ``_GATE_UNCOUNTED`` ContextVar -- is a ``kiro_crew.hooks`` global that
  owner functions reach by name, so a test that rebinds one there is the binding
  every function sees. No owner defines a module-level value, and a ``global``
  statement inside a rebound owner function writes the FACADE's namespace, which is
  what keeps ``set_builtin_app_names`` and ``set_global_hook_store`` working from an
  owner.
* The facade's own body runs BEFORE :func:`compose`, so a facade-body call reaches an
  owner function that is not yet rebound. The two UNC root memos and their
  import-time priming therefore stay in the facade: priming an un-rebound owner
  function would write the memo into the owner's namespace and leave the facade's
  cache empty.

:func:`compose` is the technique ``kiro_crew.dashboard.agent_admin.compose``,
``kiro_crew.dashboard.chat_api.compose``, ``kiro_crew.dashboard.file_api.compose`` and
``kiro_crew.dashboard.messaging_api.compose`` apply to the dashboard handlers. This
package keeps its own copy because nothing but ``hooks.py`` may import a
``hook_runtime`` module, and the five copies are pinned byte-identical.

Which responsibility each owner holds, and which constructs stay in the facade
because repository guards read them there, is recorded in
``docs/system-specs/modules/memory-skills-hooks.md`` (the "Hook runtime owners"
section under Hooks).

    """Run every function *owners* define on *namespace*.

    *namespace* is the handlers module's ``globals()``. The handlers module calls
    this once, after its own body has bound every name, so a single pass replaces
    every binding of an owner function -- in the handlers module, in the owners and
    in the owners' classes -- with its rebound copy, and no module is left holding
    the original.

    A function is an owner's when its code was compiled from that owner's file,
    whatever globals it carries: a handlers module imported a second time into the
    same process rebinds the owners onto its fresh namespace. The owners are
    imported once per process, so their classes are shared by every handlers import
    and their methods follow the most recent one.
